Fish farming is a highly lucrative business in Uganda today however fish are quite delicate and proper management of their day to day feeding is a neccessity. So we have developed this remote Fish feeding tool to easily feed fish, monitor schedule and amounts for each given time the fish are fed. Looking at people who do Urban Fish farming where monitoring may be quite a huge task; they may hire unreliable people with poor knowwledge of fish farm management and as a result cause losses. 

- We are implementing this using the Ionic framework and an Arduino microcontroller to help with the remote side.
- We also use an RTC module , Bluetooth module, Relay switch
- We are also using Intel XDK to develop some UI Components that we can later integrate with the main files in Ionic
- Ionic2 support / Angular2 / Reactive / ExpressJS
